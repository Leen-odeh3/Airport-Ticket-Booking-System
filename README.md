## Airport Ticket Booking System
This is a console C# project that I have completed while on an internship with FootHill Technologies. The Project mimics a flight reservation system than an airline would use To allow passengers to book flights and flight conductors to upload them.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to play the role of a visual midiator between a manager and a passenger. It allows the potential passenger of an Airline to checkout the available flights and book and book one with his favorite seat and desired class.

Moreover, the project permits flight managers to upload a bulk of flights using .CSV, the project also tests the inputs and returns detailed explanation of errors if existed.
